# Platformer Dash
There is my own game Platformer Dash created on Clickteam.
# The game is dead...
This date, October 1, 2023, is the official date of death of this game... R.I.P.
# The game is came back!
As some of you already knew, on October 1, 2023, I broke my computer, which caused me to lose the entire project (the so-called source code) of the game, and so, on April 2, 2024, with the help of a decompiler, I made a project from the finished latest version of the game and began to develop 0.4. Finally, this game is came back!
# When i give you the entire project (the so-called source code) of the game?
I'll give you the entire project (the so-called source code) when 1.0 will be released.
